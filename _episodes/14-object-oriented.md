## The Object Oriented Paradigm

The Object Oriented Paradigm builds upon the Procedural Paradigm, but builds code around data.

In this paradigm, we shift our focus from the process of computation, to the data with which the computation is being performed.
The overarching idea here, is that data should be structured such that all data related to the same **object** should be stored together.
This is easiest to understand when thinking about the data representing a real-world, physical object, but is also applicable to more abstract concepts.

Since all of the data representing a single object is now stored together, it makes sense to store the code representing the **behaviour** of that object in the same place.

We need some way to describe the template for how an object's data should be structured, which we call a **class**.
So, a class is a template describing the structure of some collection of data, along with the code necessary to describe the behaviour of that data.

You may wish to think of the Object Oriented Paradigm as focussing on the **nouns** of a computation.

## Using Classes

Classes are one of the fundamental concepts of Object Oriented programming - acting as the template for objects which share common attributes and behaviour.

Just like functions, we've already been using some of the classes built into Python.

~~~ python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {1: '1', 2: '2', 3: '3'}
my_set = {1, 2, 3}

print(type(my_list))
print(type(my_dict))
print(type(my_set))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'list'>
<class 'dict'>
<class 'set'>
~~~
{: .output}

Lists, dictionaries and sets are a slightly special type of class, but they behave in much the same way as a class we might define ourselves.
They each contain data, as we have seen before.
They also provide a set of functions, or **methods** which describe the **behaviours** of the data.

The behaviours we have seen previously include:

- Lists can be appended to
- Lists can be indexed (we'll make our own class with this later)
- Lists can be sliced
- The union of two sets can be found
- The intersection of two sets can be found

## Creating Classes

So how do we create and use our own class in Python?

~~~ python
class Academic:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.papers = []

alice = Academic('Alice')
print(alice.name)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Alice
~~~
{: .output}

Similar to functions, we begin by using a special keyword, in this case `class`, followed by a name, then a colon to begin a new block.
Inside this block, we define the data and behaviour that we want the class to provide.

Almost every class you define will have a `__init__` (pronounced "init" or "dunder-init" for double-underscore) **method** which is responsible for initialising any data that an instance of the class needs in order to be valid.
Note that this is slightly different from the **constructor** if you've encountered classes in other OO languages (it doesn't allocate memory for the class itself), but it's usually safe to treat it as the same.

> ## Data Classes
> Python 3.7 added a slightly different syntax we can use to automatically generate some of the class structure.
> These **Data Classes** are intended for cases where the data is more important than the behaviour, but are otherwise completely normal classes.
>
> In this example we just define the data **attributes** and their types - the `__init__` method is then generated automatically.
>
> ~~~ python
> import dataclasses
> import typing
>
> @dataclasses.dataclass
> class Academic:
>     name: str
>     papers: typing.List[typing.Dict] = dataclasses.field(default_factory=list)
>
> alice = Academic('Alice')
> print(alice)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> ~~~
> Alice
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> While dataclasses reduce the overhead in some respects, they also introduce overhead in defining some of the data types inside the class.
>
> For more information see [this page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) of the Python documentation.

### Methods

To define the behaviour of a class we can add functions which operate on the data the class contains.
We call these functions **member functions** or **methods**.

These functions are the same as normal functions (alternatively known as **free functions**), but we have an extra first parameter `self`.
The `self` parameter is a normal variable, but when we use a method of an object, the value of `self` is automatically set to the object.

~~~ python
class Academic:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.papers = []

    def write_paper(self, title, date):
        new_paper = {
            'title': title,
            'date': date
        }

        self.papers.append(new_paper)
        return new_paper

alice = Academic('Alice')
print(alice)

# Normal use of a member function
paper = alice.write_paper('A new paper', 2018)
print(paper)
print(alice.papers)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<__main__.Academic object at 0x7f4826fdff10>
{'title': 'A new paper', 'date': 2018}
[{'title': 'A new paper', 'date': 2018}]
~~~
{: .output}

### Dunder Methods

Why is the `__init__` method not called `init`?

There are a few special method names that we can use which Python will use to provide a few common behaviours, each of which begins and ends with two underscores, hence the name **dunder method**.
The most commonly used dunder method is `__init__`, but there are a few other common ones:

~~~ python
class Academic:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.papers = []

    def write_paper(self, title, date):
        new_paper = {
            'title': title,
            'date': date
        }

        self.papers.append(new_paper)
        return new_paper

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.papers[index]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.papers)

alice = Academic('Alice')
print(alice)

alice.write_paper('A new paper', 2018)
paper = alice[0]
print(paper)

print(len(alice))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Alice
{'title': 'A new paper', 'date': 2018}
1
~~~
{: .output}

In the example above we can see:

- `__str__` - converts an object into its string representation, used when you do `str(object)` or `print(object)`
- `__getitem__` - Accesses an object by key, this is how `list[x]` and `dict[x]` are implemented
- `__len__` - gets the length of an object - usually the number of items it contains

> ## Meaningful Behaviours
>
> In the previous example, we defined some of the **data** and **behaviours** of an academic, but do all of these make sense?
> What data and behaviours did we define?
> Do these really represent the real-world object we're modelling?
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > The data attributes we defined for an academic make sense, these were:
> >
> > - has a name
> > - has papers
> >
> > The behaviours we defined were:
> >
> > - can write a paper
> > - can be represented as text
> > - can get contents
> > - can get number of contents
> >
> > These last two don't really make sense as they suggest that an academic **contains** papers, which probably isn't what we intended to say.
> > To get the number of papers, we probably should have used `len(alice.papers)` from the main code and not had the `__len__` method in the class.
> > This works because the `papers` attribute is a list type, which comes with a built in `__len__` method.
> >
> > These were included in the example to demonstrate their use, but when designing your own classes, it's important to think about whether what you're designing is a meaningful representation of reality.
> > When we encounter code that behaves differently from reality, it can cause us to have incorrect assumptions about the structure and behaviour of the code.

{: .challenge}

There are many more described in the Python documentation, but it's also worth experimenting with built in Python objects to see which methods provide which behaviour.

> >     def __str__(self):
> >         return self.title + ' by ' + self.author
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Properties

The final special type of method we'll introduce is **properties**.
Properties are methods which behave like data - when we want to access them, we don't need to use brackets to call the method manually.
They're often used a bit like **getters** from other Object Oriented languages (see [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_encapsulation.asp) for more information).

~~~ python
class Academic:
    ...

    @property
    def last_paper(self):
        return self.papers[-1]

alice = Academic('Alice')

alice.write_paper('First paper', 1)
alice.write_paper('Second paper', 2)

paper = alice.last_paper
print(paper)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The `@` syntax means that a function called `property` is being used to modify the behavior of the method - this is called a **decorator**.
In this case the `@property` decorator converts `last_paper` from a normal method into a property.
We'll see tomorrow how we decorators work in more detail and how we can make our own.

Function decorators in Python are a modification of the [Decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) **Design Pattern**.
Design Patterns are established templates that we can use to design the interactions between components in software using the Object Oriented paradigm.
Many of these come from a book titled '[Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)' by Erich Gamma *et al*, published in 1994.

## Relationships

We now have a language construct for grouping data and behaviour related to a single conceptual object.
The next step is talking about the relationships between objects.

There are two fundamental types of relationship between objects which we need to be able to describe:

1. Ownership - x **has a** y - **composition**
2. Identity - x **is a** y - **inheritance**

### Composition

Composition is about ownership of an object or resource - x **has a** y.

In the case of our academics example, we can say that academics have papers.
Note that after the previous time we used this example, we clarified that academics should not *contain* papers.

~~~ python
class Paper:
    def __init__(self, title, pub_date):
        self.title = title
        self.pub_date = pub_date

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

class Academic:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.papers = []

    def write_paper(self, title, date):
        new_paper = Paper(title, date)

        self.papers.append(new_paper)
        return new_paper

alice = Academic('Alice')
paper = alice.write_paper('A new paper', 2019)

print(paper)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
A new paper
~~~
{: .output}

### Inheritance

Inheritance is about behaviour shared by classes, because they have some shared identity.

If we want to extend the previous example to also manage people who aren't academics we can add another class `Person`.
But `Person` will share some behaviour with `Academic` - in this case both have a name and show that name when you print them.

Since we expect all academics to be people (hopefully!), it makes sense to implement the behaviour in `Person` and then reuse it in `Academic`.

~~~ python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Academic(Person):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.papers = []

    def write_paper(self, title, date):
        new_paper = Paper(title, date)

        self.papers.append(new_paper)
        return new_paper

alice = Acadmic('Alice')
print(alice)

bob = Person('Bob')
print(bob)

paper = alice.write_paper('A paper', 2016)
print(paper)

paper = bob.write_paper('A different paper', 2019)
print(paper)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Alice
Bob
A paper
AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute 'write_paper'
~~~
{: .output}

We see in the example above that to say that a class inherits from another, we put the **parent class** (or **superclass**) in brackets after the name of the **subclass**.

There's something else we need to add as well - Python doesn't automatically call the `__init__` method on the parent class, so we need to do this manually within the `__init__` method of the subclass.

Python does however provide us with a shortcut to access the parent class.
The line `super().__init__(name)` gets the parent class, then calls the `__init__` method, providing the `name` variable that `Person.__init__` requires.


> ## Multiple Inheritance
>
> Python, and a few other languages, allow you to have a class inherit from multiple parent classes, which is known as **multiple inheritance**.
> In a class with multiple parent classes, it may not be obvious which parent class we should go to to look for a method (see [Deadly Diamond of Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem)).
> In order to resolve this, Python uses a method known as [C3 Linearisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization), but this is in the realm of advanced Python and we should not expect people who use our code to know this.
>
> Because of this complexity, it is recommended not to use multiple inheritance, unless you are certain that this is the simplest way to describe the problem you wish to solve.

### Composition vs Inheritance

When deciding how to implement a model of a particular system, you often have a choice of either composition or inheritance, where there is no obviously correct choice.
For example, if we need to produce a model of a photocopier:

~~~ python
class Machine:
    pass

class Printer(Machine):
    pass

class Scanner(Machine):
    pass

class Copier(Printer, Scanner):
    # Copier `is a` Printer and `is a` Scanner
    pass
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~ python
class Machine:
    pass

class Printer(Machine):
    pass

class Scanner(Machine):
    pass

class Copier(Machine):
    def __init__(self):
        # Copier `has a` Printer and `has a` Scanner
        self.printer = Printer()
        self.scanner = Scanner()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Which of these is better?
Well, both of them seem like reasonable approximations of the thing we're trying to model.
It seems fair to say that a photocopier *is a* printer and *is a* scanner, but it also seems fair to say that a photocopier *has a* printer and *has a* scanner.

It depends on the context, but generally, we should favour **composition over inheritance** (*has a* over *is a*), as it leads to relationships between objects being slightly simpler to manage.
It's quite common for software developers, when introduced to classes, to produce code which has long, complicated inheritance heirarchies in places where composition would work equally well.
Try to avoid this temptation - the simpler you can keep your code, the better.
